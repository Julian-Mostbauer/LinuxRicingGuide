                            Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux
                            distributions, known for its ease of use and strong
                            community support. Based on Debian, Ubuntu aims to
                            provide a user-friendly experience with regular
                            releases and a focus on accessibility. Since its
                            first release in 2004, Ubuntu has become a
                            cornerstone of the Linux ecosystem, powering
                            desktops, servers, and cloud environments worldwide.
