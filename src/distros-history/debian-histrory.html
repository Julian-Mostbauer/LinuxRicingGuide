                        <p>
                            Debian is one of the most influential Linux
                            distributions in the open-source community. Known
                            for its stability, security, and dedication to free
                            software principles, it has served as the foundation
                            for numerous other distributions, including Ubuntu,
                            Linux Mint, and Kali Linux. Debian’s commitment to
                            collaboration, its robust package management system
                            (APT), and its community-driven development model
                            have set high standards for the Linux ecosystem. As
                            one of the oldest Linux distributions, Debian
                            remains a cornerstone of open-source software
                            development.

                                <p>
                                    Debian was founded by Ian Murdock, who
                                    announced the project on August 16, 1993, as
                                    "the Debian Linux Release." Unlike other
                                    distributions at the time, Debian was
                                    envisioned as a collaborative effort guided
                                    by the open-source community rather than a
                                    single individual or company. The project’s
                                    name combined his name (Ian) and that of his
                                    then-girlfriend, Debra.

                                    Debian 0.91 was released, featuring a simple
                                    package system and 474 software packages.
                                    The project began attracting developers and
                                    users who appreciated its community-centric
                                    philosophy.

                                    Debian introduced the Debian Social Contract
                                    and the Free Software Guidelines (DFSG),
                                    formalizing its commitment to free software
                                    and community-driven development. These
                                    documents became foundational for the
                                    open-source community and inspired other

                                    (APT). APT simplified software installation
                                    and updates, becoming a defining feature of
