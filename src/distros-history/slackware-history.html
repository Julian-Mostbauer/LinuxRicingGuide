                        <p>
                            Slackware is a Linux distribution created by Patrick
                            Volkerding in 1993. Originally based on Softlanding
                            Linux System, Slackware has been the basis for many
                            other Linux distributions, most notably the first
                            versions of SUSE Linux distributions, and is the
                            oldest distribution that is still maintained.
