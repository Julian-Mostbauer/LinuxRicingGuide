                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The story of Linux OS begins in 1991 when Linus
                            Torvalds, a student at the University of Helsinki in
                            Finland, developed the Linux kernel. Initially, the
                            project was a hobby for Torvalds, who wanted to
                            create an alternative to the MINIX operating system.
                            The Linux kernel became publicly available and
                            quickly attracted a community of developers who
                            contributed to its growth and evolution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By 1993, Slackware became the first commercially
                            available Linux distribution, marking a significant
                            step in the widespread adoption of Linux. Following
                            this, other distributions such as Debian, Red Hat,
                            SUSE, and Ubuntu emerged, each with unique features
                            and capabilities to cater to different types of
                            users and requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rise of the internet played a crucial role in
                            the development of Linux. Developers from around the
                            world collaborated to improve the system, creating a
                            vibrant open-source community. This collaboration
                            model allowed Linux to evolve rapidly and become a
                            powerful and versatile operating system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Linux gained
                            popularity among businesses and government
                            organizations due to its stability, security, and
                            cost-effectiveness. The development of
                            server-oriented distributions made Linux a preferred
                            choice for web hosting and enterprise applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As technology advanced, Linux expanded beyond
                            traditional computing environments. One of the most
                            significant milestones was the emergence of Android,
                            a Linux-based operating system for smartphones and
                            tablets, which has become the dominant mobile
                            platform worldwide.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, Linux continues to thrive as a cornerstone of
                            modern computing, powering everything from personal
                            desktops to cloud servers and embedded systems. Its
                            historical journey is a testament to the power of
                            open-source collaboration and innovation.
