                        <p>
                            Void Linux is an independent Linux distribution that
                            uses the X Binary Package System (XBPS) package
                            manager, which was designed and implemented from
                            scratch, and the runit init system. The distribution
                            is available for the Intel x86, ARM, and MIPS
                            architectures with a focus on simplicity, clarity,
                            and minimalism.

                                <p>
                                    Void Linux was created in 2008 by Juan
                                    Romero Pardines, a former developer of
                                    NetBSD. The initial release focused on
                                    providing a simple and minimalistic Linux
                                    distribution.

                                <strong>2012 – XBPS Package Manager</strong>
                                <p>
                                    In 2012, Void Linux introduced the X Binary
                                    Package System (XBPS), a new package manager
                                    designed and implemented from scratch to
                                    provide a fast and efficient way to manage
                                    software packages.

                                <strong>2014 – Runit Init System</strong>
                                <p>
                                    In 2014, Void Linux adopted the runit init
                                    system, replacing the traditional SysV init
                                    system. Runit is known for its simplicity
                                    and speed, aligning with Void Linux's
                                    philosophy.

                                <p>
                                    In 2016, Void Linux expanded its support to
                                    include ARM and MIPS architectures, making
                                    it available for a wider range of devices
                                    and users.

                                    In 2018, Void Linux introduced support for
                                    the musl C library, providing an alternative
                                    to the GNU C Library (glibc) and further
                                    enhancing the distribution's flexibility and
                                    performance.

                                    on simplicity, clarity, and minimalism.
