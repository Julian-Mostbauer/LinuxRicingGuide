                        <p>
                            Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution
                            designed for digital forensics and penetration
                            testing. It is maintained and funded by Offensive
                            Security Ltd. It was developed by Mati Aharoni and
                            Devon Kearns of Offensive Security through the
                            rewrite of BackTrack, their previous forensics Linux
                            distribution.
