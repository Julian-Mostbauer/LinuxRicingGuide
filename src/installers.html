            <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-box"></i>Snap</h2>
            <p>Snap is a software packaging and deployment system developed by Canonical for operating systems that use
                the Linux kernel. The packages, called snaps, and the tool for using them, snapd, work across a range of
                Linux distributions and allow upstream software developers to distribute their applications directly to
                users.</p>

            <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-box"></i>APT</h2>
            <p>Advanced Package Tool, or APT, is a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle
                the installation and removal of software on Debian, Ubuntu, and related Linux distributions. APT
                simplifies the process of managing software on Unix-like computer systems by automating the retrieval,
                configuration, and installation of software packages, either from precompiled files or by compiling
                source code.</p>
            <p>For more information, visit the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Apt">Debian Wiki</a>.</p>

            <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-box"></i>Portage</h2>
            <p>Portage is a package management system originally created for and used by Gentoo Linux and also by Chrome
                OS, Sabayon, and Funtoo Linux among others. Portage is based on the concept of ports collections. Gentoo
                is sometimes referred to as a meta-distribution due to the extreme flexibility of Portage, which makes
                it operating-system-independent.</p>
