                                    Qubes OS is a security-focused desktop operating
                                    system that aims to provide security through
                                    isolation. Virtualization is performed by Xen, and
                                    user environments can be based on Fedora, Debian,
                                    Whonix, and Microsoft Windows, among other operating
                                    systems.
