                            Artix Linux is a rolling-release distribution based on Arch Linux that distinguishes itself
                            by not using the systemd init system; instead, it offers alternatives like OpenRC, runit,
                            s6, and dinit. This design choice provides users with greater control over system
                            initialization and service management. Artix maintains its own repositories and supports
                            various desktop environments, including LXQt, LXDE, MATE, Cinnamon, KDE Plasma, and XFCE.
                            While it offers a high degree of customization and adheres to the KISS (Keep It Simple,
                            Stupid) principle, Artix is generally recommended for more experienced users comfortable
                            with manual system configuration and management.
