                            Arch Linux is a lightweight, rolling-release distribution that follows the KISS (Keep It
                            Simple, Stupid) philosophy, giving users complete control over their system. It provides a
                            minimal base installation, requiring manual setup and configuration, making it ideal for
                            advanced users. Arch uses the Pacman package manager and offers access to the AUR (Arch User
                            Repository) for a vast range of software. Known for its excellent documentation via the Arch
                            Wiki, it delivers a constantly updated system with the latest software while prioritizing
                            simplicity and customization.

                            <strong>2002 – Founding of Arch Linux</strong>
                            <p>
                                Arch Linux was founded by Judd Vinet, a Canadian programmer, who was inspired by the
                                simplicity of CRUX, another minimalist Linux distribution. He aimed to create a
                                lightweight and flexible system that adhered to the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
                                philosophy. The first version, Arch Linux 0.1 (Homer), was released on March 11, 2002,
                                marking the beginning of what would become one of the most influential Linux
                                distributions.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li
                            class="list-group-item bg-transparent text-light"
                        >
                            <strong>2003 – Pacman and First Full Release</strong>
                            <p>
                                In 2003, Arch Linux gained its first major full release with version 0.5 (Nova). This
                                year was significant because Pacman, Arch’s powerful package manager, was further
                                improved to handle automatic dependency resolution, making software management more
                                efficient. Pacman became one of Arch Linux's defining features, distinguishing it from
                                many other distributions.
                            </p>

                            class="list-group-item bg-transparent text-light"
                        >
                            <strong>2007 – Transition to Community-Driven Development</strong>
                            <p>
                                Judd Vinet stepped down as the lead developer in 2007, passing the project to Aaron
                                Griffin. This marked the transition of Arch Linux from a personal project to a
                                community-driven distribution. Under Griffin’s leadership, the Arch Linux community
                                flourished, and the Arch User Repository (AUR) grew into a vital part of the ecosystem,
                                enabling users to easily share and install packages.

                        >
                            <strong>2012 – Systemd Adoption</strong>
                            <p>
                                In 2012, Arch Linux made a controversial but forward-thinking decision to adopt systemd
                                as its default init system, replacing the traditional SysVinit. This move aligned Arch
                                with modern Linux development trends, improving boot speed and system management. Though
                                divisive at the time, it helped solidify Arch as a cutting-edge distribution that
                                prioritizes modern technology.
                            </p>

                            <strong>2020 – Arch Linux Installer and ISO Changes</strong>
                            <p>
                                A major change came in 2020 with the introduction of an official guided installer
                                (archinstall), making the installation process more accessible to newcomers while still
                                allowing manual setup. Additionally, Arch Linux ISOs began shipping with zstd
                                compression, significantly speeding up package installation. These improvements
                                reflected Arch’s balance between minimalism and usability.

                            <strong>2023 – 21 Years of Rolling Releases</strong>
                            <p>
                                By 2023, Arch Linux celebrated over two decades of continuous development, maintaining
                                its position as a leading rolling-release distribution. It remained popular among Linux
                                power users and developers, thanks to its customizability, cutting-edge software, and
                                strong community support.
