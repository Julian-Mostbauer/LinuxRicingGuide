                            CentOS is a Linux distribution that provides a free,
                            community-supported computing platform functionally
                            compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat
                            Enterprise Linux (RHEL). In January 2014, CentOS
                            announced the official joining with Red Hat while
                            staying independent from RHEL, under a new CentOS
                            governing board.
