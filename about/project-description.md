## Project Name

Linux Ricing Guide

## Initial Situation

Customizing (or “ricing”) a Linux environment can be overwhelming, especially for beginners. With so many options for window managers, terminals, shells, and themes, it’s difficult to know where to start. This project addresses that gap by providing a clear, interactive guide to help users understand what ricing is and how to build a setup tailored to their needs.
